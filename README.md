# UzbekPOS: A Manually Annotated POS Dataset for Uzbek

## Overview

**UzbekPOS** is a high-quality, manually annotated **Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging dataset** for the Uzbek language.  
It is designed to support research and development in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, computational linguistics, and corpus-based studies for **Uzbek**, a morphologically rich and under-resourced Turkic language.

The dataset provides expert POS annotation, broad domain coverage, and multiple standardized formats suitable for both academic research and applied NLP systems.
